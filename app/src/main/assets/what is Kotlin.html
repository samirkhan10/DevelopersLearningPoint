<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Concise:&nbsp;</strong>Kotlin reduces writing the extra codes. This makes Kotlin more concise.</li>
<li><strong>Null safety:&nbsp;</strong>Kotlin is null safety language. Kotlin aimed to eliminate the NullPointerException (null reference) from the code.Interoperable.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperable:&nbsp;</strong>Kotlin easily calls the Java code in a natural way as well as Kotlin code can be used by Java.</li>
<li><strong>Smart cast:&nbsp;</strong>It explicitly typecasts the immutable values and inserts the value in its safe cast automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Compilation Time:&nbsp;</strong>It has better performance and fast compilation time.</li>
<li><strong>Tool-friendly:&nbsp;</strong>Kotlin programs are build using the command line as well as any of Java IDE.</li>
<li><strong>Extension function:&nbsp;</strong>Kotlin supports extension functions and extension properties which means it helps to extend the functionality of classes without touching their code.</li>
