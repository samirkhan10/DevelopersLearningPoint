<h1 class="h1">Flutter IDE</h1>
<p>IDE (editors) are software programs that allow the user to create and edit text files. In the development field, editors usually refer to the source code editors that include many special features for writing and editing code.</p>
<p>We can create Flutter apps using any text editor that can easily combine with our command-line tools. However, it is recommended to use editor plugins (IDE) for a better experience. These plugins come with Syntax highlighting, code completion, widget editing assists, run &amp; debug support, and many other features.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/flutter">Flutter</a>&nbsp;supports several&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/ide-full-form">IDE</a>&nbsp;to build the apps. Some of them are discussed below, but you can go ahead if you want to use a different editor.</p>
